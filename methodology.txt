Methodology

This project employs a Hybrid RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) approach, combining deterministic keyword analysis with semantic LLM generation.

Why Keywords? 
While LLMs are excellent at conversation, they are "probabilistic", meaning they can sometimes vary in how they summarize numbers.
- Purpose: We use a custom keyword extraction layer to provide deterministic quantification.
- Significance: If the graph shows a 50% increase in "Green Energy" mentions, that is a literal fact from the document. This acts as a "source of truth" to validate the AI’s qualitative summaries.
- Effect on Chatbot: This does not limit the chatbot. The chatbot uses semantic search (FAISS) to understand context even when keywords aren't present. The keywords simply provide a measurable "heatmap" of government priorities.

 The RAG Pipeline
1. Retrieval: Uses FAISS to find semantically relevant chunks.
2. Augmentation: Injecting those chunks as context into the prompt.
3. Generation: Using Ollama (Llama 3) to synthesize a coherent, grounded answer.
